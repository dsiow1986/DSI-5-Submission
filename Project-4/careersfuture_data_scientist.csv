You will lead all the processes from data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, to training models and deploying them to production. The ideal candidate will be passionate about artificial intelligence and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. Currently the model is being built using Python so the ideal candidate will have deep expertise working with Python libraries and bindings for machine learning and NLP (including deep learning frameworks such as Keras, TensorFlow, and MXNet). This will be deployed as a microservice, leveraging Flask for the REST API with the back end packaged into a Docker container. The project seeks to derive value from the data contained in sales interactions - meeting notes, emails, calendar invites, etc and to categorise these against open opportunities, accounts and contacts held within the CRM. In an ideal world the candidate would also have knowledge of the Salesforce API, given this is a widely used CRM platform, however this is not necessary and training can be provided. The successful candidate will inherit a working POC model and will be expected to augment and enrich the functional capabilities of the model to take it to production quality, as well as to continue to evolve the accuracy, precision and recall of the finished product.","About Cognopia Cognopia is a leader in Sales-as-a-Service across the APAC region.
