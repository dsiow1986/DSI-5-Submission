This involves:a) building of a data collector for retrieving social media datasets,b) integrating and extending an in-house developed deep learning based multi-label classification algorithm for inferring user interests’ from the collected social datasets, andc) integrating and populating the results of the classifier with telco datasets into a proprietary link analysis algorithm contributed by a renowned research institute in Singapore for downstream analysis.The applicant should bring creativity and vision to the project and be able to execute independently, or as part of a small team. The ability to learn rapidly and a willingness to explore are essential. This is a unique opportunity with huge upside for developing data analytics & integration skills and contacts available almost nowhere else.      Requirements    Skills and Experience: • Qualifications in Computer Science, Engineering, Maths or equivalent with relevant experience will be considered• Some project hands-on experience in software development relating to one or more of the following areas: Machine Learning and Text Mining is desirable• Know Java or Python• Familiarity with at least one Machine Learning toolkit: NLTK, R, SparkML, Weka, scikit-learn is preferable but not a must.• Ability to work with databases (MySQL, MongoDB etc)• Some experience involving social media APIs, open linked data or other real-time data sources is advantages• Good opportunity to build experience in using open-sourced machine learning and APIs/tools to develop text classifications tools for prediction• Able to work hands-on with minimal supervision or assistance• Successful candidates will be considered for future longer term projects upon contract completion• Entry-level candidates are welcomed to apply    ",
